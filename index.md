## Focus

- NVMe / Linux Kernel / System Software
- Automation tools and reproducible workflows

## About

I am a **Systems & Platform Engineer** with expertise in Linux kernel, storage systems (NVMe), and DevOps-oriented platform design.

My career journey combines deep technical roots (Linux kernel development, NVMe driver feature expansion, system debugging) with cross-disciplinary projects in sensor data collection, AI, and large-scale software engineering.

Highlights:

- Linux Kernel & Storage: NVMe driver feature extension (SPF → MPF), kernel build & migration projects, automated validation pipelines.
- Cross-disciplinary Projects:
    - Sensor data collection & synchronization
    - Enterprise-level semiconductor equipment project
- Leadership & Collaboration: SSAFY (Samsung SW Academy for Youth) class leader, (Exicon) new-hire leader, technical mentor & instructor experience.
- Global Mindset: Exchange student in China, English multicultural collaboration and strong communication skills.

I thrive in environments where system reliability, structural problem-solving, and cross-functional collaboration are essential, and I aim to grow into a Platform Architect building resilient and scalable developer ecosystems.
