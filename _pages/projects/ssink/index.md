# Inkjet Printing Equipment Quality Prediction Method - SSINK

Developed 'SSINK', a system that predicts and analyzes the quality of inkjet printing equipment in real-time, aiming to maximize production efficiency by preemptively detecting errors that may occur during the manufacturing process. Focused on improving large-capacity image processing speed and analysis accuracy.

**Highlights:** Drop Simulation and Data Analysis, Feature Integration and Distribution (Executable File), Support for Large-Capacity Image Loading and Cell Segmentation

**Tech:** C++, C#, Python 3.9, GDAL, OpenCV, Visual Studio 2022
