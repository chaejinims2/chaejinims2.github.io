- title: Structural Leadership
  description: I lead by clarifying complexity. I break down systems into understandable modules, enabling smoother onboarding and communication within teams.
  example: [
    "Redesigned the PF-Slot-Thread architecture in a visual and modular form, allowing new team members to quickly grasp and contribute to our NVMe driver stack.", 
    "", 
    ""
  ]
  key: ["System Thinking", "Modular Design", "Process Clarity"]

- title: Supportive Leadership
  description: 
  example: [
    "Developed Cherry Utility — a personal CLI toolkit to automate repetitive tasks and simplify debugging routines, shared with teammates to increase productivity.", 
    "Authored an OJT manual and SOP documentation to accelerate onboarding of junior engineers."
  ]
  key: ["Enablement", "Knowledge Sharing", "Mentorship by Infrastructure"]

- title: Empathetic Technical Decision-Making
  description: I balance technical logic with emotional intelligence. I approach code reviews and architectural decisions with empathy, especially when dealing with legacy systems.
  example: [
    "Proposed an incremental refactoring plan rather than a total overhaul, respecting existing workflows and reducing friction for collaborators.", 
    "In reviews, I prioritize understanding over fault-finding, asking “Did I interpret your intent correctly?”"
  ]
  key: ["Legacy-Aware Design", "Collaborative Reviews", "Empathetic Judgment"]

- title: Documentation-Driven Culture Builder
  description: I believe what’s not documented doesn’t scale. I design workflows, logs, and debug systems that are traceable, reusable, and self-explanatory.
  example: [
    "Created custom debug log formats and issue-tracking templates for the team, ensuring consistent knowledge sharing and future-proof traceability.", 
    "", 
    ""
  ]
  key: ["Self-Documenting Systems", "Repeatable Processes", "Traceability"]

- title: Bridge Between Domains
  description: I act as a translator between domains—engineering and design, logic and emotion. I value clarity of expression as much as correctness of implementation.
  example: [
    "While developing an image-processing simulation for OLED printing (SSINK), I created a GUI overlay that translated algorithmic thresholds into intuitive visual indicators for non-engineering stakeholders.", 
    "", 
    ""
  ]
  key: ["Cross-functional Communication", "Technical Translation", "Human-System Interface"]

- title: Meta-Level Thinking & Vision Design
  description: I don’t just build systems—I design frameworks for thinking. I’m driven by questions like “Why does this structure exist?” and “What future does it lead to?”
  example: [
    "", 
    "", 
    ""
  ]
  key: ["Meta Thinking", "Structural Intent", "Long-Term Planning"]
